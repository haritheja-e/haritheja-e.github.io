I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at NYU. I'm currently working with [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com) in the Generalizable Robotics and AI Lab (GRAIL). 

I am interested in developing algorithms for learning generalizable policies and in scaling robot learning to the real-world.
